# 🚀 DSA Practice Journey

A repository dedicated to tracking my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. This repo contains solutions to problems from various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank.

## 📌 Goals
* Master fundamental Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs).
* Improve problem-solving speed and algorithmic thinking.
* Document different approaches (Brute Force, Optimized) for the same problem.
